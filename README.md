The dataset student-mat.csv has been obtained through a survey of students math courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students(for further info refer the Attribute description.txt file). Different methods to predict students ability to pass have been used such as Linear Regression,Decision Tree and Naive Bayes method.I have also tested for a relationship between age and performace as well as sex and performance using correlation.The analysis has been performed using R and a pdf has  been rendered using RMarkdown.
